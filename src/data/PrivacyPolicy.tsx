Facilitate partner sharing: Enable shared Circles and mutual journaling with partners;

3.2 To Train and Improve Our Proprietary AI Models
CRITICAL DISCLOSURE:
We use your journal entries, relationship data, and interaction patterns to train, develop, and improve our proprietary emotional intelligence algorithms and AI models.
AI Training is ENABLED by default for all consumer accounts (Free and Premium plans).
Specifically, we:
Analyze your User Content to identify emotional patterns, relationship dynamics, and behavioral insights;
Train machine learning models on anonymized and aggregated relationship data to improve AI response quality, accuracy, and empathy;
Develop new features based on common relationship challenges and user needs identified in the data;
Refine our emotional intelligence algorithms to provide more accurate, empathetic, and helpful insights;
Create benchmark datasets for research and development of relationship AI technology; and
Improve safety systems to detect and prevent abuse, harassment, and harmful content.

How to Opt Out:
Go to Settings → Privacy → "Do not train on my content" and toggle OFF.
Opting out applies to new content only; previously collected data may remain in existing training datasets and models.
Opting out does not affect your ability to use the Service.

Data Processing for AI Training:
Your data is anonymized and aggregated before being used for model training;
Individual identifiers (names, specific locations, unique identifying details) are removed or generalized using industry-standard techniques;
We use automated filtering and obfuscation to remove sensitive information;
Perfect anonymization cannot be guaranteed; there is a theoretical risk of re-identification; and
Anonymized data may be retained indefinitely, even after account deletion.

3.3 For Research and Development
Conduct research on relationship patterns, emotional well-being, and intimacy dynamics;
Publish research findings using anonymized, aggregated data (no individual identification); and
Share anonymized datasets with academic or commercial research partners.

3.4 For Business Operations
Detect and prevent fraud, abuse, and security threats;
Enforce our Terms of Service;
Comply with legal obligations and respond to lawful requests;
Protect our rights, property, and safety; and
Facilitate business transactions (mergers, acquisitions, asset sales).

3.5 For Marketing (With Your Consent)
Send promotional emails about new features and offers (you can opt out);
Display personalized ads (if applicable); and
Conduct surveys and gather feedback.

4. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION
4.1 With Your Partner (Shared Circles)
When you create a shared Circle with a partner, both parties have access to:
All journal entries within that Circle;
Relationship insights and summaries;
Timeline events and milestones; and
AI-generated analysis of the relationship.
Important: Your partner can view, download, and potentially retain this data even if you later terminate the Circle or delete your account. We cannot control what your partner does with shared data.

4.2 With Service Providers
We share data with trusted third-party vendors who help us operate the Service:
Cloud hosting providers (AWS, Google Cloud) - data storage and processing;
AI/ML infrastructure (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI) - AI processing;
Payment processors (Stripe) - payment processing (PCI-DSS compliant);
Analytics services (Google Analytics, Mixpanel) - usage analytics;
Email services (SendGrid, Mailchimp) - transactional and marketing emails; and
Customer support tools (Zendesk, Intercom) - support ticket management.
These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for providing services to us. They cannot use your data for their own purposes.

4.3 Third-Party AI Services
Important Disclosure:
Your journal content may be sent to third-party AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI) for processing and generating insights;
These providers have their own privacy policies and data practices;
We use enterprise agreements with enhanced privacy protections where available; and
Third-party AI providers are contractually prohibited from using your data to train their public models, but you should verify their privacy policies independently.
We do not share your personal identifiers with third-party AI services when possible.

4.4 For Legal Reasons

Compliance with national security or law enforcement requirements.
We will notify you of legal requests unless prohibited by law.

4.6 Aggregated and Anonymized Data
We may share or sell anonymized, aggregated data that cannot reasonably identify you with:
Research institutions and universities;
Commercial partners and third-party companies;
Investors and business partners; or
The public (e.g., in research publications, whitepapers, or blog posts).
Example: "75% of couples using Belluh AI report improved communication after 30 days."
This aggregated data may include insights derived from your content but does not contain information that identifies you personally.

4.7 With Your Consent
We may share your information with third parties if you explicitly consent (e.g., integrations with other apps, third-party features).

5. DATA RETENTION
5.1 Active Accounts
We retain your personal information as long as:
Your account is active;
Needed to provide the Service; or
Required for legitimate business purposes (analytics, fraud prevention, legal compliance).

Anonymized and aggregated data derived from your content may be retained indefinitely for AI training, research, and model improvement;
Backup systems may retain copies for up to 180 days for disaster recovery;
Legal or regulatory requirements may mandate longer retention; and
Shared Circle data: We cannot delete content your partner has separately saved, exported, or retained.

5.3 Opt-Out of AI Training Before Deletion
If you opt out of AI training before deleting your account, your content will not be used in new training runs.
Your data may remain in already-trained models and datasets created before opt-out.
We will stop using your content for future model training runs.

5.4 Legal Holds
Data subject to legal holds, investigations, or disputes will be retained until the matter is resolved, regardless of account deletion.

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:
Technical Safeguards:
Encryption in transit: TLS 1.3/SSL for all data transmission;

Regular audits: Security assessments, penetration testing, vulnerability scanning;
Secure infrastructure: SOC 2 Type II compliant cloud providers;
